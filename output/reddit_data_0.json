AITA for getting upset that now his mom, his brother and his brothers girlfriend attending her baby showers, meet the baby etc (that she had with another man) ? I get upset and try to talk to my boyfriend about it but he says he\u2019s tried, and it\u2019s out of his control that his family doesn\u2019t care what he thinks /wants. And has given up, he doesn\u2019t want to disturb the house. But I\u2019m still affected by this. \n\n(We live with his mom at the moment) \n\nAlso, the man she had this baby with is her daughter\u2019s ex baby daddy. (She\u2019s made the family cut all ties with the daughter/sister, because she\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d. I don\u2019t know much about this situation tho)\n\nAdvice, thoughts etc, all welcome thanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/1ke1l2f/my_in_laws_attend_my_bfs_exs_events_is_this_wrong/"}

But if you are a young adult (F23) who likes a sense of direction and planning, how to best navigate this?\n\nFor example, here is a thought that has been ruminating for quite a while now: I am 23 years old, soon concluding my master's studies. I live abroad and I am also expected to travel for internships after, further studies or work. I would like to start viewing dating more seriously. Im not talking marriage marriage at my current age, but it would be nice to slowly have somewhat of a path carved out, even with intentions/expectations, have someone who shares your worldview and who aligns with your values, wants to build with you and explore life/the world with you. I feel it can be genuinely very rewarding.\n\nSo, assuming I want to do that, how do I navigate the impermanent nature of the sensitive early 20s phase, the immense amount of FOMO, thirst for exploration, travel, and learning vs. the willingness to have a relationship & stability with the potential to progress into something more serious? Should I date someone I like and give them the time of day knowing I'll be for example in Brussels for the next 7 months and then leave, should I just live it up and see where it goes, approach it in terms of making a compromise and moving to their country (if they are a foreigner), should I just approach connections with people solely as friendships and not want any of this at this life stage im currently at?
